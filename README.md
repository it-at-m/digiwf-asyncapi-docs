# DigiWF asyncapi-docs

DigiWF asyncapi-docs is a spring boot starter library that generates asyncapi documentation for spring-cloud-stream consumers and producers for [digiwf](https://digiwf.oss.muenchen.de).
Therefore, it adds support for spring-cloud-stream to springwolf.

At the moment only the spring-cloud-stream kafka binder is supported. If you want to use this with another binder please open an issue and request the feature.
